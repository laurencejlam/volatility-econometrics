# Advanced Volatility Forecasting: Time Series & Machine Learning Approaches

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of volatility forecasting models using both classical time series techniques and modern machine learning approaches. The project is designed to showcase rigorous quantitative research methods, statistical modeling, and practical financial engineering applications.

## Research Objective

Accurate volatility forecasting is fundamental to quantitative finance - it's essential for:
- Risk management and assessment
- Derivatives pricing and hedging
- Portfolio optimization and allocation
- Trading strategy development

This project aims to:
1. Develop and compare various volatility forecasting models
2. Evaluate their statistical accuracy and financial practicality
3. Analyze the information content of different predictive features
4. Investigate regime-dependent performance characteristics

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- Daily price data from major equity indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ)
- Macroeconomic indicators (interest rates, VIX, yield curve)
- Market microstructure features (volume, bid-ask spread)

### Models Implemented
1. **Classical Time Series Models**
   - EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)
   - GARCH(1,1) and variants (EGARCH, GJR-GARCH)
   - HAR (Heterogeneous Autoregressive) models

2. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
   - LSTM Neural Networks
   - Gaussian Process Regression

3. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Model combination techniques
   - Regime-switching frameworks

### Evaluation Metrics
- Statistical: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, Diebold-Mariano test
- Financial: Option pricing accuracy, volatility-targeting Sharpe ratios
- Directional: Hit ratio for volatility regime changes
